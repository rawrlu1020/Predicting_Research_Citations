Project with NYU Stern Program for Undergraduate Research to create better model for evaluating professors based on number of research citations
Faculty: Panos Ipeirotis
Professor Panos is looking into how to better evaluate professors at universities, based on the number of research citations they product each year, so we tested various predictive models to determine if any could be used to evaluate professors
Tools used: R and Python
